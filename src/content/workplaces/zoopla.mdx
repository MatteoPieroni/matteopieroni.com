## Projects

### Accessibility

    Since joining I participated in the Accessibility Working Group, and I have been co-leader it since late 2021.
    We worked on different projects in order to make the website more accessible, for example: the implementation of accessibility testing in all our team's cypress suites, the research and coding of accessibility in our component library, the education of teams to accessibility practices.

    I am particularly proud of running regular empathy labs, with a focus on screen reader usage, that have been attended by more than a 70 people from a variety of disciplines and teams.

    In 2023, our team was awarded the 3rd prize for Contentsquare "Best Digital Accessibility Mission award".

### Design System and Component Library

    I have worked on the current design system and component library, which is used by all the teams in the company, since its inception.

    One of my main focuses was on research and implementation of accessibility, I had the opportunity and challenge on understanding how to improve our `dialog`, `button` disabled state, and many more.

    I also took up the management of deprecations, working with different teams to make sure their code was up to date and we could manage the lifecycle and versioning of the package.

### Architecture for personalisation

    As tech lead of the user and personalisation team, I worked on the architecture of the personalisation system, which is used to show personalised content to our users.

    This project was a challenge because it involved a lot of different teams and data points, and it was a great opportunity to set a strategy that would allow for speed and scalability, across different services and stacks.

### Engineering enablement

    I worked on several projects spanning large parts of the codebase, for the implementation of our monorepo tools, the implementation of the new design system, set up of accessibility testing, spending control with our third parties.

    I was also tech lead of the web enablement team, which is responsible for the whole front end codebase, developer experience and the tools that the developers use to build the website.
