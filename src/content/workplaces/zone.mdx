At Zone, my role was Front End Developer, working mainly on a few apps that will be used by healthcare systems and companies to request and carry out genomic testing for patients.

The technology used is state-of-the-art for React developers and the different applications have similar stacks though serving different purposes in the stages of genomic testing.

## Projects

### Analytics

    Our applications were using a custom implementation to send analytics data related to UX KPIs. As part of the work we wanted to do on it, we streamlined the solution for adding, updating, and sending the data. The new implementation was a success for the dev team and for the UX and DA teams.

### Component library

    I was part of the team that implemented the in-house shared component library that was used across all the client's applications. The library was built with Storybook and was published to a private NPM registry.

### Design study POC for a government project

    I overlooked and implemented a POC for a government project. In order to have the designs aligned with the government's standards, I had to use the Government Digital Services Design System. The POC was a success and the project was implemented.

### Find Football project

    I oversaw the team that implemented the initial version of the <a href="https://find.englandfootball.com/" target="_blank">Find Football project</a>. I had to liaise with the BE team to align our work. The project was coded to be compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (level AA).
