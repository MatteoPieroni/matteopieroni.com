At Abel & Cole, my role was Front End Developer, working on the e-commerce web platform. The platform is based on an MVC .NET backend, that used Razor and jQuery.
I have been part of the transition to modern architecture, mainly using React and Redux, and CI/CD pipeline on Azure.

## Projects

### Performance Audit

After a performance audit, I devised and worked on optimisation, which resulted in a satisfying gain, especially in Time To First-Paint.
    
### Accessibility Improvements

I analysed the existing accessibility of the website and set myself as A11y champion, writing and changing code to use the best tools of the languages, to provide the best experience for all users.I also created and published an Npm package called Acest, to be added to the pipeline for testing the accessibility of the deployed websites.

### Introduction of Jest

I introduced Front End unit tests using Jest as the testing framework, to test vanilla JavaScript and React/Redux code. In React I also introduced the use of Enzyme.

### POC of App

I created a React Native application, cooperating with a Back End engineer for the API/GraphQL side.The application gives our internal staff the ability to buy items in our in-house shop.At Zone, my role is Front End Developer, working mainly with a client, a few apps that will be used by healthcare systems and companies to request and carry out genomic testing for patients.\nThe technology used is state-of-the-art for React developers and the different applications have similar stacks though serving different purposes in the stages of genomic testing.## Technologies- React- Redux- @testing-library- enzyme- Formik- react-hook-form- @reach/router- react-router-dom- Npm- GIT- Jenkins- Lerna- ATI Analytics## projects### Analytics    Our applications were using a custom implementation to send analytics data related to UX KPIs. As part of the work we wanted to do on it, we streamlined the solution for adding, updating, and sending the data. The new implementation was a success for the dev team and for the UX and DA teams.
