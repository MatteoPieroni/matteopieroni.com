## Projects

### Pieroni.it 3.0
As a trial for a future e-commerce website, we decided to rebuild the platform using Woocommerce.\nI designed and developed the whole website, in collaboration with a copywriter and an agency for SEO

### Intranet Portal

I created the company intranet portal, using AngularJS with the backend in Firebase Realtime Db and Storage, with features like the ability to send an SMS to customers (through a 3rd party API), and to calculate the cost of delivery with our trucks (through Google Maps Places and Distance APIs).\nFor the administrators, the portal would also show the visits of the main website (using Google Analytics), the activity in our Facebook Workplace groups, the chronology of the communications sent via SMS, and a utility to create already branded communication posters (using Node).

### Website performance optimisation

To optimise websiteâ€™s performance, I worked on caching and assets optimisation of the Wordpress backend and frontend, which resulted in a score of 92 on Google Speed Insights.

### Website SEO optimisation

I worked with an SEO agency to make sure every iteration of our website was fully optimised for SEO, specifically for Local SEO. This work consisted in improving the speed of the website, optimisation of the assets, the connection between all sections, and the use of Schema.org specific markup.
