      <p>
        Throughout my time as a software engineer, I was lucky enough to work
        with amazing people and on a variety of different products, some used by
        millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the old days of Wordpress and jQuery, I've picked up a couple
        specific focuses that I really enjoy: accessibility and architecture. I
        love building well thought out, performant, and maintainable software
        that is usable by as many folks as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I am a certified safari guide and an enthusiastic
        wildlife photographer. I love exploring nature and capturing moments
        through my camera lens, with the importance of detail, patience, and
        perspective at the forefront of my thoughts â€” qualities I bring to my
        engineering work as well.
